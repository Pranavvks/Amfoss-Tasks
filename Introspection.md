#Introspection
 a)__I would like to give a brief snippet of my background that would show traits of my character which I believe you would appericiate and  certainly be valueable to the club .I had choosen
 PCB stream. I didn't have both mathematics and computer science as my subjects. Seven months back ,  I was preparing for CLAT law entrance 
 examination. Everything was going well , I was scoring decent marks in my mock tests but I never found joy in the process.Quarantine period gave me enough
 time to reorient and shift my perspective.Back then,I also had a backup option of electing BCA if I didn't the crack the entrance examination.Days passed , I was unhappy with the work I was doing I decided to take a step back 
 and try out something else. I decided to try out programming I started to learn Python(Class XI and XII) syallabus but i couldn't complete it. Not being from a mathematical background I felt like this might be the reason.
 So I decided to learn grade XI mathematics intially i looked for a personal tutor and was not able to find someone. I decided to learn from Youtube and online references.After few months I was able to cover almost all topics of Class XI mathematics.
 There were days where I felt like quitting but I didn't give in.**Books and Rocky(I)** movie kept me motivated.__
 
 That one was pretty long but I felt like sharing , currently after completing a few tasks and task-10 in particular I am more confident. **If choosen to be a member of the club I would certainly give in the time,effort,dedication and patience to match the club standards.**
 
b)__I would love to get enrolled in some project which would keep me engaged and moreover find a project which gives me satisfaction in the work that I do.__

c)__I will definintely contribute towards open source projects at a later stage after equipping myself with the tools required in order to do that.I would also be of great help to my forthcoming juniors.Even after my graduation , I hope to stay in touch with club members and also to help other club members__. 

d)__It can't get better.I certainly believe the tasks were a kind of mini simulation of what it takes to be a great Computer engineer. It also felt the tasks were meant to teach us how to fish instead of handing over the fish to us.At first glance it might seem a bit overwhelming but once we start apporaching the tasks methodically it is doable__

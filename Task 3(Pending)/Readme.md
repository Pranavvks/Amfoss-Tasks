**Hackerrank questions were tough for me. I was only able to do one question. The reason being i firmly believe is that i need more practice at problem solving. I almost take a day and a half to solve this question. Later on I decided to comeback to this task. Also I was always focused on getting the best possible solution and when i calculated my solution with the time complexity it always seemed to exceed the time limit. I promise , I would certainly spend more time at practicing more questions and will definitely improve my problem solving skills.**

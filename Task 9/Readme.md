After completing task5 i was able to do it much more faster also this task wasn't complicated. However it was essential to have a clear understanding of HTML DOM concept and also to have a basic knowledge of using CSS selectors. I had to go through the telegram web console and after a bit of searching in the console itself i was able to figure out the tag with html event attribute.Also i went through the Browser Object Model in w3schools website to solve this problem.

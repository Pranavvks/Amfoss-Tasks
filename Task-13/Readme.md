**This task was quite challenging.** __The user will be warned if they go beyond the given range of distance that is [0,100]. I have used here two mechainsms inorder to warn the user.
  First one being , the user will be shown a warning message in the serial port. Also i have added a piezo buzzer which will change its tone when the obstacle reaches the above limit prescribed.
  I had to built several other sample circuits before I could complete this one.

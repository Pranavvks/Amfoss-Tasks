This task was quite challenging for me as i had no prior knowledge in javascript.However i was able to learn the very basics from CS50. But I had no idea about topics like asynchronous funcitons i had to go through w3schools.com to learn more about it. Also i was not able to complete data set required for the problem at times my PC also got stuck in between while fetching the data. However, it worked fine for one of the examples given in the resources.

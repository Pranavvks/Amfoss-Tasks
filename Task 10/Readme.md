I strongly believe there is nothing like CS50 and the way Professor David taught was amazing.This task enabled me to solve other tasks. It really taught me how to approach a problem and how to break it apart into smaller chunks and then concatenate all these chunks to finally solve it. Also the walkthroughs by Brain was exteremely useful. The task was challenging at times but i managed to complete it . This task took me around __18 days__ to complete.
